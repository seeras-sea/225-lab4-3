Feature: Ensure that only port 80 is open

  I want to verify that only port 80 is open on the target system

  Scenario: Scan the target system for open ports
    Given "nmap" is installed
    When I launch a "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -p 1-65535 -T4 --open 10.48.10.116
      """
    Then the output should contain:
      """
      80/tcp open
      """
    And the output should not contain any other open ports except 80
